##Pelias ElasticSearch Plugin

Elasticsearch comes with a wide variety of analyzers that can be used just by specifying them in the Elasticsearch settings file. For our geocoder, however, we need broader control over how search queries and string fields are treated. This means extending the functionality of ElasticSearch by subclassing parts of the library it's based on, Lucene.

###On analysis
We use analysis to make searches more flexible, and more relevant. In Elasticsearch, we analyze both specified fields on each document on indexation, and also searches made to those documents.

Our current analysis stack goes like this:

1.- **Tokenization**: Lucene's ```whitespace``` [tokenizer](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenizers.html) divides a string into basic tokens when separated by a white space.

> ```"Old St Station" => ["Old", "St", "Station"]```

2.- **Lowercase filtering**: by applying a lowercase filter, we make sure that the user gets the same results regardless of the casing used in the document.

> ```["Old", "St", "Station"] => ["old", "st", "station"]```

3.- **ASCII folding**: All diacritics and special characters are either reduced to its ASCII form or removed.

> ```["a", "coruña"] => ["a", "coruna"]```
> ```["yorckstraße"] => ["yorckstrasse"]```
> ```["málaga"] => ["malaga"]```

4.- **Ampersand filtering**

> ```["highbury", "&", "islington"] => ["highbury", "and", "islington"]```
> ```["johnson&johnson"] => ["johnson and johnson"]``` *(notice we need to retokenize after this)*

5.- **Synonym mapping**: Read more about it [here]("https://github.com/pelias/synonyms")

> ```["old", "st", "station"] => ["old", "street", "station"]```
> ```["st", "michaels"] => ["saint", "michaels"]```

###Requirements
There needs to be an ElasticSearch instance running on your server, so we'll assume you have Java installed as well. To package and install the plugin, you need [Maven]("http://maven.apache.org/").

###Installation

```shell
bin/plugin -url file:./target/release/elasticsearch-PeliasPlugin-1.3.4.zip -install pelias-plugin
```

###Usage

Once the plugin is installed, you should restart ES and add the analyzer to your settings mapping, as shown [in the ES site]("http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-custom-analyzer.html").
